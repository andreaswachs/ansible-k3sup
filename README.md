# Ansible Collection: k3sup

This repository contains sample code for automating k3sup installation and management using Ansible.

[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) is a radically simple IT automation engine that automates cloud provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, intra-service orchestration, and many other IT needs.
[k3sup](https://k3sup.dev/) is a light-weight utility to get from zero to KUBECONFIG with [k3s](https://k3s.io/) on any local or remote VM. All you need is `ssh` access and the `k3sup` binary to get `kubectl` access immediately.

## Installation

`ansible-galaxy collection install vandot.k3sup`
